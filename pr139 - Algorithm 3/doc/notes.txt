	A - All
	S - Segments
	R - Recent

inputs, initial (static)

	points
		Pt_TS-003  - point, top 3% of target scan
		Pt_TS-010  - point, top 10%
		Pt_TS-050  - point, top 50%
		Pt_TS-100  - point, all cells
		Pt_NS2-50  - point, top 50% of narrowing-scan-2 (no B)  (maybe?)
		
		Pt_LM-003  - point, nearest to pt_003, touching nearest M
		Pt_LM-010  - point, nearest to pt_010, touching nearest M
		Pt_LM-050  - point, nearest to pt_050, touching nearest M
		
		Pt_RM-02   - point, calculated using recent M (2s?)  (maybe??)
		Pt_RM-06   - point, calculated using recent M (6s?)  (maybe)
		Pt_RM-10   - point, calculated using recent M (10s?)  (maybe??)
		
	inner points?
		projection: [Pt_TS-010] 50% past [Pt_LM-010]
	
	radius?
		Rad_S-003  - radius, top 3% of target scan
		Rad_S-010  - radius, top 10%
		Rad_S-050  - radius, top 50%
		Rad_S-100  - radius, all cells
		
		Rad_RM-06-10 - radius, top 10% of recent M (6s?)

	M_CA   - M count, all
	M_CS   - M count, applied to segments

inputs
	Range_SR    - average range to most recent segment (all M b adjusted)
	Range_MR02  - average range to recent M (2s?)
	Range_MR06  - average range to recent M (6s?)
	Range_MR10  - average range to recent M (10s?)

outputs
	% of each input point
		how to measure confidence?
	dynamic degree
		(most likely requres more layers)


[ideas, dynamic focused]

change in area ?
d*r^2 ?

input: change in r^2 ?
