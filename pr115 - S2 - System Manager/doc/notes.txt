[TO DO]

adjust the thumbnail upload interval. cannot be more than every 5 min. 
    maybe adjust per time of day.
    maybe make configurable (and consider time of day).
    [at this time, updating every 10 minutes will consume 30~40% of quota]

[PROJECT BUILD]

	unreliable cross-project maven dependencies?
		adjust run config - classpath
			either/both:
				(1) ensure maven is at the top
				(2) add dependent project

[NOTES]



Rules seem to break easily (PrepareTesla.drl would often not work)

Limitations?
	* no blank lines in conditionals ?
	* avoid using line-comments (assume line breaks are removed)

Acceptable:
	* tab char in rule
